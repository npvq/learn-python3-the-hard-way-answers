Rules for reading code:

Reading for Conditionals and Loops:

1. Functions and what they do.
2. Where each variable is first given a value.
3. Any variables with the same names in different parts of the program. These may be trouble later. 4. Anyif-statementswithoutelseclauses.Aretheyright?
5. Any while-loops that might not end.
6. Any parts of code that you canâ€™t understand for whatever reason.

Reading for Class:

1. For each class give its name and what other classes it inherits from.
2. Under that, list every function it has and the parameters they take.
3. List all of the attributes it uses on its self.
4. For each attribute, give the class this attribute is.
