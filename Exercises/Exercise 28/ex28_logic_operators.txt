Equality Operators:

==  equal               	If the values of two operands are equal, then the condition becomes true.
!=  unequal                 If values of two operands are not equal, then condition becomes true.
>   greater-than            If the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.
<   less-than           	If the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.
>=  greater-than-equal  	If the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.
<=  less-than-equal         If the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.

Binary Operators:

&   Binary AND              Operator copies a bit to the result if it exists in both operands
|   Binary OR               It copies a bit if it exists in either operand.
^   Binary XOR              It copies the bit only if it is set in one operand and not both.
~   Binary Ones Complacent  It is unary and has the effect of 'flipping' bits.
<<  Binary Shift Left       The left operands value is moved left by the number of bits specified by the right operand. (This numerically multiplies by 2 per digit moved)
>>  Binary Shift Right      The left operands value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right operand. (This numerically divides by 2 per digit moved)
